# Economic Insecurity and Populist Attitudes in the Netherlands

This repository contains code and a short paper that study how **economic insecurity** relates to **populist attitudes** in the Netherlands before and after two major shocks: the **2015–2016 immigration crisis** and the **COVID‑19 pandemic**.

## 🔎 Research question

**To what extent does economic insecurity influence populist attitudes among Dutch citizens?**

**Main hypothesis:** Higher economic insecurity is associated with stronger populist attitudes, controlling for trust in institutions and political ideology.

---

##  Data

We use **World Values Survey (WVS)** data for the Netherlands from two waves:

- **Wave 6 (≈2012)** — pre‑crisis baseline
- **Wave 7 (≈2022)** — post‑immigration‑crisis & post‑pandemic period

>  Due to licensing, the datasets are **not** included. Please download the Stata `.dta` files from WVS and place them under `data/`:
>
> - `data/WV6_Data_Netherlands_Stata_v20201117.dta`
> - `data/WVS_Wave_7_Netherlands_Stata_v5.0_new.dta`

### Variable mapping (WVS → analysis)
| Construct | WVS code | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Support for a strong leader** | `Q235` (Wave 6 uses `V127`) | “Having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections” (good/bad) | Higher ⇒ more authoritarian preference |
| **Confidence in political parties** | `Q71` (often labeled `V116` in some codebooks) | Confidence/trust in parties | Higher ⇒ more trust (anti‑populism proxy) |
| **Economic satisfaction (proxy for insecurity)** | `Q50` | Satisfaction with household financial situation (1–10) | We define **treated** = 1 if `Q50 < 5` (economically insecure) |
| **Left–Right ideology** | `Q240` | Self‑placement (left=1 … right=10) | Control |
| **Age** | `Q262` | Respondent age | Control |
| **Education level** | `educ_level` | Recode to low/medium/high (0/1/2) | Control |

If your local WVS files use slightly different labels, update the mapping in the notebook’s “Data prep” cell.

## Methods

Two families of models are implemented in the notebook:

1. **Pooled OLS** (Wave 6 + Wave 7):
   - `Q235 ~ Q50 + Q240 + Q262 + educ_level`
   - `Q71  ~ Q50 + Q240 + Q262 + educ_level`

2. **Difference‑in‑Differences (DiD)** to leverage pre/post contrast by (in)security:
   - Define `post = 1` for 2022 (Wave 7), else `0` for 2012 (Wave 6).
   - Define `treated = 1` if economically insecure (`Q50 < 5`), else `0`.
   - Estimate:  
     `DV ∼ post + treated + post:treated + Q240 + Q262 + educ_level`, where `DV ∈ {Q235, Q71}`.

**Robustness**: the notebook includes **ordered logistic** models for the ordinal DVs using `statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model.OrderedModel`.

## 📊 Visualizations (generated by the notebook)

- **Parallel trends** check for `Q71` (institutional trust) by (in)security.
- **Heatmap** of `Q235` (strong leader) vs **ideology** (`Q240`).
- **Coefficient plot** comparing OLS effects for `Q235` and `Q71` (with 95% CI).
- **Box/strip plots** of `Q71` by **financial satisfaction** (`Q50`) and **education**.

Outputs render inline in the notebook; you can save figures by adding `plt.savefig("figures/<name>.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")` if needed.

```

├─ Populism_Netherlands.ipynb
├─ Islambekov_Economic_Insecurity_and_Populist_Attitudes.pdf
├─ data/                         # ← put WVS .dta files here (ignored by git)

##  Quick start

### 1) Create environment
```bash
# using pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or: using conda / mamba
conda create -n wvs-netherlands python=3.8 -y
conda activate wvs-netherlands
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Add data
Download the two WVS Netherlands `.dta` files and place them into `data/` with the exact filenames shown above.

### 3) Run the analysis
```bash
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```
Open `Populism_Netherlands.ipynb`, run all cells. If your files have different names/paths, **edit the first data‑loading cell**.

## Key findings 

- **Education** is a strong and consistent predictor: higher education ⇒ **lower** support for a strong leader and **higher** institutional trust.
- **Ideology** (more right‑wing) predicts **higher** support for a strong leader, but has weaker/insignificant links to trust in parties.
- **Economic insecurity** (low `Q50`) is tightly linked to **lower** confidence in political parties. Its direct link to “strong leader” support is weaker.
- **DiD**: no clear, unique *post‑2015* shift in strong‑leader preferences among the economically insecure versus secure; the broader decline in trust appears more **general** (affecting both groups).

See the PDF for the narrative, references, and figures contextualizing the results.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **ValueError: file not found** — Ensure the `.dta` files are placed under `data/` and filenames match.
- **Variable not found** — WVS variable codes sometimes differ by release; inspect your `.dta` columns and adjust the mapping cells.
- **OrderedModel not available** — Upgrade `statsmodels` to ≥0.13.
